#Haptic Braille

This application was written to interface with the Vibrotact Vibratto. It teaches how to interpret haptic braille using several basic examples.
Designed and built a web application to learn to understand braille through haptics, tactile feedback which recreates the sense of touch using complex vibrations.
Characters are sent through serial to the Vibratto Board which controls an array of 3x2 6g coin vibrators.
Wrote arduino sketch to translate from text to haptic braille representation.
Interface for 'learn' and 'practice' applications. 
Learn application uses visual and tactile information to ensure the efficient learning of haptic braille (double encoding).
Practice application sends the haptic representation of a random character and the user needs to select the correct choice to receive the next character
